Hello! I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where I obtained a Master's in Computer Science & a Bachelor's in Math & CS. 

My academic interests include functional programming in OCaml & Haskell, the Coq proof assistant, compilers and type systems. I also enjoy thinking about abstract algebra & graph theory. 

At Penn, I was fortunate to be able to do programming languages research as part of [PLClub](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/):                  
- I am currently working on [Mica](https://github.com/ngernest/mica), an automated tool for conducting property-based testing of OCaml modules, advised by Professor [Benjamin Pierce](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/) and [Harry Goldstein](https://harrisongoldste.in). I presented Mica at the [ICFP '23 Student Research Competition](https://icfp23.sigplan.org/track/icfp-2023-student-research-competition#About).
- I also worked on a team mechanizing type soundness proofs for the Hindley-Milner type system in Coq, advised by Professor [Stephanie Weirich](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/).
