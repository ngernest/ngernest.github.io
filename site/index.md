Hi! I'm a second-year Computer Science PhD student at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu), working on programming languages research.
I'm interested in functional programming, property-based testing, proof assistants and type systems. 

This summer, I'm interning with the Automated Reasoning group at AWS, working on property-based testing infrastructure for Lean.

I did my undergrad at [Penn](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/), majoring in Math & CS. At Penn, I worked on [property-based testing](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/lectures/soln/05-quickcheck/QuickCheck.html) research, advised by [Harry Goldstein](https://harrisongoldste.in) & [Benjamin Pierce](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/). Before grad school, I worked in industry for a year as a data engineer. 

Outside of PL, I enjoy [playing the pipe organ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyzOiJ5OZbo) and running. 

Feel free to take a look at my [resume](./pdfs/resume.pdf), or the [projects](./projects) page on this site!
