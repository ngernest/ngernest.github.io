Hi there! I'm a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where I obtained a Master's in Computer Science & a Bachelor's in Math & CS. 

My academic interests include functional programming in OCaml & Haskell, the Coq proof assistant, compilers and type systems. I also enjoy thinking about abstract algebra & graph theory. 

At Penn, I was fortunate to be able to do programming languages research as part of [PLClub](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/index.html):                  
- I am currently working on [Mica](https://github.com/ngernest/module_pbt), an automated tool for conducting property-based testing of OCaml modules, advised by Prof. [Benjamin Pierce](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/).
I'll be presenting this work at the ICFP '23 Student Research Competition this fall!          
- I also worked on a project mechanizing type soundness proofs for the Hindley-Milner type system in Coq, advised by Prof. [Stephanie Weirich](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/). 

<!-- 
As an undergrad math major, I conducted two independent studies where I learnt about:
- Graphons & extremal graph theory (advised by Prof. [Bhaswar Bhattacharya](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/bhaswar/))
- Applying electric network theory to random walks on graphs (via Penn's [Directed Reading Program](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~tbraz/drp/)) 

I've also previously interned at [Perpay](https://perpay.com) & [PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)](https://www.pwchk.com/en/issues/cybersecurity-and-privacy/dark-lab.html), where I worked on data engineering             
& web security projects respectively. 

Before that, I worked as a research assistant for Wharton's [ESG Analytics Lab](https://analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/esg-analytics-lab/), where I performed statistical analysis of time-series ESG datasets, contributing to a publication [(Babcock et al. 2022)](https://www.fcltglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/Walking-the-Talk_Stakeholder_Capitalism_Report.pdf).  -->
