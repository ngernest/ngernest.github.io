Hi! I'm a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu). I previously studied at [Penn](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/), majoring in Math & CS. 

At Penn, I worked on [property-based testing](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/lectures/soln/05-quickcheck/QuickCheck.html) research, advised by [Harry Goldstein](https://harrisongoldste.in) & [Benjamin Pierce](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/).

My academic interests include functional programming in OCaml & Haskell, the Coq proof assistant, type systems and compilers. 

Before grad school, I worked in industry for a year as a data engineer.
