## About me
Hi there! I'm a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where I obtained a Master's in Computer Science
and a Bachelor's in Math & CS. 

My academic interests include functional programming in OCaml & Haskell, proof assistants (eg. Coq), compilers and type systems. I also enjoy thinking about abstract algebra & graph theory. 

At Penn, I was fortunate to be able to do programming languages research as part of the [PLClub](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/index.html) group:     
- I developed [Mica](https://github.com/ngernest/module_pbt/commits/dev), an automated tool for conducting property-based testing of OCaml modules, advised by Prof. [Benjamin Pierce](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/) and [Harry Goldstein](https://harrisongoldste.in).                             
- I also worked on a project mechanizing type soundness proofs about the Hindley-Milner type system in Coq,   
advised by Prof. [Stephanie Weirich](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/). 

As an undergrad math major, I also conducted two independent studies where I learnt about:
- Graphons & extremal graph theory (advised by Prof. [Bhaswar Bhattacharya](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/bhaswar/))
- Proving PÃ³lya's Random Walk Theorem using electric network theory (as part of Penn's [Directed Reading Program](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~tbraz/drp/))
